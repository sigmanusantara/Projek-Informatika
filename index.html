        <h1>Global Warming: Terrifying Phenomenon</h1>
        <marquee>Design by: Abigail </marquee>
        <P>     Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet's overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned.</P>
